## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- **Jira API Access** - Choose one of two methods:
  - **REST API** (Recommended) - Simpler setup, better performance
  - **MCP Server** (Optional) - For teams standardized on MCP
- Optional: `gh` CLI tools installed and configured, for GitHub access

## Setup Options

### Option 1: REST API (Recommended)

**Best for:** Most users, especially for `/jira:analyze-rfe` command

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Simpler setup (just environment variables)
- ✅ 4x faster performance for analyze-rfe
- ✅ No server to run or maintain
- ✅ Works with all commands

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Get Jira Personal Access Token**
   - Visit: https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?selectedTab=com.atlassian.pats.pats-plugin:jira-user-personal-access-tokens
   - Click "Create token"
   - Copy the token

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   export JIRA_URL="https://issues.redhat.com"  # Optional, defaults to this
   ```

   Add to your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
   ```bash
   # Jira API Configuration for Claude Code
   export JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN="your_token"
   export JIRA_URL="https://issues.redhat.com"
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install requests aiohttp
   ```

4. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN" \
        "https://issues.redhat.com/rest/api/2/myself"
   ```

**Detailed Setup Guide:** See [skills/analyze-rfe/SETUP.md](skills/analyze-rfe/SETUP.md) for complete instructions

### Option 2: Setting up Jira MCP Server (Optional)

```bash
# Start the atlassian mcp server using podman
podman run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 -e "JIRA_URL=https://issues.redhat.com" -e "JIRA_USERNAME" -e "JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN" -e "JIRA_SSL_VERIFY" ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest --transport sse --port 8080 -vv
```

Add the MCP server to Claude:

```bash
# Add the Atlassian MCP server
claude mcp add --transport sse atlassian http://localhost:8080/sse
```

#### Getting Tokens

For your Jira token, use https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?selectedTab=com.atlassian.pats.pats-plugin:jira-user-personal-access-tokens

### Notes and tips

- Do not commit real tokens. If you must keep a project-local file, prefer committing a `mcp.json.sample` with placeholders, and keep your real `mcp.json` untracked.
- Consider using the [rh-pre-commit](https://source.redhat.com/departments/it/it_information_security/leaktk/leaktk_components/rh_pre_commit) hook to scan for secrets accidentally left in commits.
- The `atlassian` server example uses an MCP container image: `ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest`.
- If you prefer Docker, replace the `podman` command with `docker` (arguments are typically the same).
- If Podman is installed via Podman Machine on macOS, ensure it is running: `podman machine start`.
- Keep `JIRA_SSL_VERIFY` as "true" unless you have a specific reason to disable TLS verification.
- Limit active MCP servers: running too many at once can degrade performance or hit limits. Use Cursor's MCP panel to disable those you don't need for the current session.

## Installation

Ensure you have the ai-helpers marketplace enabled, via [the instructions here](/README.md).

```bash
# Install the plugin
/plugin install jira@ai-helpers
```

## Available Commands

### `/jira:solve` - Analyze and Solve JIRA Issues

### `/jira:create` - Create Jira Issues

Create well-formed Jira issues (stories, epics, features, tasks, bugs, feature requests) with intelligent defaults, interactive guidance, and validation. The command applies project-specific conventions, suggests components based on context, and provides templates for consistent issue creation.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create a story
/jira:create story MYPROJECT "Add user dashboard"

### `/jira:create-release-note` - Generate Bug Fix Release Notes

Automatically generate bug fix release notes by analyzing Jira bug tickets and their linked GitHub pull requests. The command extracts Cause and Consequence from the bug description, analyzes PR content (description, commits, code changes, comments), synthesizes the information into a cohesive release note, and updates the Jira ticket.

**Usage:**
```bash
/jira:create-release-note OCPBUGS-38358
```

**What it does:**
1. Fetches the bug ticket from Jira
2. Extracts Cause and Consequence sections from bug description
3. Finds all linked GitHub PRs
4. Analyzes each PR (description, commits, diff, comments)
5. Synthesizes Fix, Result, and Workaround information
6. Validates content for security (no credentials)
7. Prompts for Release Note Type selection
8. Updates Jira ticket fields

**Release Note Format:**
```
Cause: <extracted from bug description>
Consequence: <extracted from bug description>
Fix: <analyzed from PRs>
Result: <analyzed from PRs>
Workaround: <analyzed from PRs if applicable>
```

**Prerequisites:**
- MCP Jira server configured
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Access to linked GitHub repositories
- Jira permissions to update Release Note fields

**Example Output:**
```
✓ Release Note Created for OCPBUGS-38358

Type: Bug Fix

Text:
---
Cause: hostedcontrolplane controller crashes when hcp.Spec.Platform.AWS.CloudProviderConfig.Subnet.ID is undefined
Consequence: control-plane-operator enters a crash loop

### `/jira:analyze-rfe` - Analyze RFE and Generate EPIC/Story Breakdown

Analyze a Request for Enhancement (RFE) from Jira and generate a structured breakdown of Epics, user stories, and their outcomes. This helps transform customer-driven RFEs into actionable implementation plans for sprint and release planning.

**Usage:**
```bash
/jira:analyze-rfe RFE-1234

# Or with full URL
/jira:analyze-rfe https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-1234
```

**What it does:**
1. Fetches the RFE from Jira
2. Parses nature, description, business requirements, affected components
3. Generates EPIC(s) with scope and acceptance criteria
4. Generates user stories in "As a... I want... So that..." format
5. Defines outcomes for each story (customer/business value)

**Output:** Structured markdown report with epics, stories, and outcomes. Use `/jira:create` to create the generated epics and stories in Jira.

See [commands/analyze-rfe.md](commands/analyze-rfe.md) for full documentation.
